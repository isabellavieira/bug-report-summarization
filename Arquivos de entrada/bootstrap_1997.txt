Update typeahead() data-source option.

alepee commented
I didn't find how to update data-source with typeahead. I tried to make it work simply with a new typehead() call and new values, but it does not update at all.
The first call works perfectly :) but the second one does.. nothing :(
$('select').change(function() {
    var id = $(this).val();
    $.getJSON(url + id, function(data) {
        $('input').typeahead({
            source: data
        });
        $('input.hide').slideDown(120);
    });
});

I ran into the same issues and finally figured a solution. When you are passing the object into typeahead(), nothing is changed if you don't also pass in duplicates of all the other properties and functions that are expected.
Luckily there's a better way.
Access the typeahead input's data attribute and modify the source array directly. E.g:
var autocomplete = $('input').typeahead();
autocomplete.data('typeahead').source = newSource; //where newSource is your own array
I just finished writing some code that will let me use remote data querying on the Typeahead module. https://gist.github.com/1848558
One issue I found is that due to how Typeahead is written, after you modify the source array the results don't get picked up till the next keystroke. In the gist above, I got around this by setting the source to [] before doing my XHR request, setting it in the callback function with the results, then triggering a keyup event on the input element again. Typeahead does technically trigger 2x, but since the initial source array is 0 length it doesn't do any lookups. I also had to add an active status that prevents an endless loop of XHR requests due to the 2x keyup events.

yeah, we need to make this more extensible for sure. We'll be revisting the data source soon. Thanks for the feedback!

alepee commented
@geuis I tried your method by store input.typeahead() object into a variable and it works like a charm!
Thank you :)

reefdog commented
@fat: +1 for making this more extensible and obvious! :)

Wow .. I wasted 5 hours of my life before I found this post .. thanks @geuis for your solution ..

geuis commented
Glad you found it useful.

It would be nice to have a better API for this, the current workaround looks a little hacky.

satgi commented
thank you so much,i've spent almost 2 to 3 hours working on this problem.

thanks guys, save my life

geuis commented
Is this issue still active? I thought the data source issue would have been addressed by now and my little hack made obsolete.

rodleviton commented
Thanks @geuis.

ScotterC commented
@geuis Still really useful code for eliminating duplicates even when using Typeahead's newest methods. Thank you!

My first failed attempt was updating the data-source using jquery. And landed up here. Thank you @geuis

greivinlopez commented
@geuis thank you!! You're the man! :)

This doesn't actually work for me – I get TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined every time I try var autocomplete = $('input').typeahead();. $('input') itself is as expected, but and has a working typeahead in the UI, but .typeahead() still returns an error.
This happening to anyone else?

zda commented
PS – You can reproduce this error on the Typeahead.js website itself: http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/
> $('.example-countries .typeahead').typeahead();
=> TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined

@zda The typeahead widget referenced in this issue is Bootstrap v2's own old typeahead (bootstrap-typeahead.js), NOT Twitter's Typeahead.js.

zda commented
Yes, just realized this – thanks.

geuis commented
Hmm I can update this gist for 3.1 if its needed. Does the new typeahead code support remote data sources?

cvrebert commented
@PWKad The typeahead from Bootstrap v2 was removed. For help using the suggested replacement, Twitter's Typeahead, ask on that project's GitHub.

PWKad commented
@cvrebert I realized that and deleted my comment after I read through everything again my bad
