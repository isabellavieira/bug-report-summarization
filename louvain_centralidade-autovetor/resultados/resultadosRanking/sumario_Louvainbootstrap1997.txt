cvrebert commented @pwkad the typeahead from bootstrap v2 was removed . for help using the suggested replacement , twitter 's typeahead , ask on that project 's github .

jeanlyn commented thanks ! it 's work !

geuis commented i ran into the same issues and finally figured a solution . when you are passing the object into typeahead (), nothing is changed if you don 't also pass in duplicates of all the other properties and functions that are expected . luckily there 's a better way . access the typeahead input 's data attribute and modify the source array directly . e .g: var autocomplete = $('input').typeahead(); autocomplete .data('typeahead').source = newsource ; //where newsource is your own array i just finished writing some code that will let me use remote data querying on the typeahead module . https ://gist.github.com/1848558 one issue i found is that due to how typeahead is written , after you modify the source array the results don 't get picked up till the next keystroke . in the gist above , i got around this by setting the source to [] before doing my xhr request , setting it in the callback function with the results , then triggering a keyup event on the input element again . typeahead does technically trigger 2x , but since the initial source array is 0 length it doesn 't do any lookups . i also had to add an active status that prevents an endless loop of xhr requests due to the 2x keyup events .

cvrebert commented @zda the typeahead widget referenced in this issue is bootstrap v2 's own old typeahead (bootstrap-typeahead.js), not twitter 's typeahead .js.
