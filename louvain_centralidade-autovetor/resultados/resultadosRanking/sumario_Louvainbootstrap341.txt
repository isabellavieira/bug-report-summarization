jxs commented +1

jxs commented great suggestions on this thread , agree with comment above mine , tnhx ! and +1 for autocomplete on twitter bootstrap

mdo commented very happy to say work has started on this for bootstrap 2 .0 and the early version is now in 2 .0-wip. we 'll finish it off for launch as soon as possible .

michaelmior commented instead of explicitly storing remote data , it 's probably easier and more flexible to allow the source to be specified as a callback which returns the results to use given the currently entered text . then you can implement remote data or anything else you want on top .

santuxus commented i needed styles for autocomplete too . as long as it 's not implemented in bootstrap , i think that jquery autocomplete is a quite nice solution : http ://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/. jquery ui has it 's own stylesheets (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/master/themes/base) and in case of autocomplete combined with bootstrap css it doesn 't look bad . all jquery css element classes start with prefix 'ui-', so there are no conflicts .

batuhan commented this would be awesome .

drewda commented that 's really pushing the boundaries of thinking of bootstrap as a set of presets for page styling . such a wide variety of autocomplete scripts are already available [1]. it 'd be great for bootstrap to provide increasing amounts of styling for others ' widgets , but to build up an entire widget set within bootstrap ? hey , if it 's feature -complete and as stylish as the rest of bootstrap , i 'd use it --but i don 't know if anyone wants to actually develop it . [1] some of my favorites , off the top of my head : http ://documentcloud.github.com/visualsearch/ http ://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ https ://github.com/laktek/jquery-smart-auto-complete

fat commented this is what we have planned for 2 .0: http ://cl.ly/b7mf

ottoallmendinger commented @etaque thanks a lot , that is precisely what i was looking for .

ouranos commented @austegard: i 've made some modifications to the html generated by marcopolo to add boostrap styles . still work in progress but it looks nice so far : https ://github.com/ouranos/jquery-marcopolo/tree/bootstrap
