Update typeahead() data-source option.

alepee commented on Feb 15, 2012 I didn't find how to update data-source with typeahead. I tried to make it work simply with a new typehead() call and new values, but it does not update at all. The first call works perfectly :) but the second one does.. nothing :( $('select').change(function() { var id = $(this).val(); $.getJSON(url + id, function(data) { $('input').typeahead({ source: data }); $('input.hide').slideDown(120); }); });

geuis commented on Feb 16, 2012 I ran into the same issues and finally figured a solution. When you are passing the object into typeahead(), nothing is changed if you don't also pass in duplicates of all the other properties and functions that are expected. Luckily there's a better way. Access the typeahead input's data attribute and modify the source array directly. E.g: var autocomplete = $('input').typeahead(); autocomplete.data('typeahead').source = newSource; //where newSource is your own array I just finished writing some code that will let me use remote data querying on the Typeahead module. https://gist.github.com/1848558 One issue I found is that due to how Typeahead is written, after you modify the source array the results don't get picked up till the next keystroke. In the gist above, I got around this by setting the source to [] before doing my XHR request, setting it in the callback function with the results, then triggering a keyup event on the input element again. Typeahead does technically trigger 2x, but since the initial source array is 0 length it doesn't do any lookups. I also had to add an active status that prevents an endless loop of XHR requests due to the 2x keyup events.

fat commented on Feb 17, 2012 yeah, we need to make this more extensible for sure. We'll be revisting the data source soon. Thanks for the feedback!

alepee commented on Feb 17, 2012 @geuis I tried your method by store input.typeahead() object into a variable and it works like a charm! Thank you :)

reefdog commented on Mar 4, 2012 @fat: +1 for making this more extensible and obvious! :)

rubic0n commented on Jun 11, 2012 Wow .. I wasted 5 hours of my life before I found this post .. thanks @geuis for your solution ..

geuis commented on Jun 12, 2012 Glad you found it useful.

balaclark commented on Jun 29, 2012 It would be nice to have a better API for this, the current workaround looks a little hacky.

satgi commented on Aug 21, 2012 thank you so much,i've spent almost 2 to 3 hours working on this problem.

paulbarbu commented on Aug 28, 2012 Thank you!

beatoss commented on Oct 24, 2012 Thank you!

ralfschimmel commented on Oct 28, 2012 Nice, thanks, saved me a couple of hours there.

RusAlex commented on Nov 21, 2012 thanks guys, save my life

geuis commented on Nov 23, 2012 Is this issue still active? I thought the data source issue would have been addressed by now and my little hack made obsolete.

rodleviton commented on Nov 28, 2012 Thanks @geuis.

ScotterC commented on Dec 14, 2012 @geuis Still really useful code for eliminating duplicates even when using Typeahead's newest methods. Thank you!

jayyvis commented on Mar 4, 2013 My first failed attempt was updating the data-source using jquery. And landed up here. Thank you @geuis

greivinlopez commented on Mar 16, 2013 @geuis thank you!! You're the man! :)

zda commented on Jan 30, 2014 This doesn't actually work for me – I get TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined every time I try var autocomplete = $('input').typeahead();. $('input') itself is as expected, but and has a working typeahead in the UI, but .typeahead() still returns an error. This happening to anyone else?

zda commented on Jan 30, 2014 PS – You can reproduce this error on the Typeahead.js website itself: http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/ > $('.example-countries .typeahead').typeahead(); => TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined

cvrebert commented on Jan 30, 2014 @zda The typeahead widget referenced in this issue is Bootstrap v2's own old typeahead (bootstrap-typeahead.js), NOT Twitter's Typeahead.js.

zda commented on Jan 30, 2014 Yes, just realized this – thanks.

geuis commented on Jan 30, 2014 Hmm I can update this gist for 3.1 if its needed. Does the new typeahead code support remote data sources?

cvrebert commented on Feb 26, 2014 @PWKad The typeahead from Bootstrap v2 was removed. For help using the suggested replacement, Twitter's Typeahead, ask on that project's GitHub.

PWKad commented on Feb 26, 2014 @cvrebert I realized that and deleted my comment after I read through everything again my bad

jeanlyn commented on Mar 12, 2014 thanks ! it's work!
